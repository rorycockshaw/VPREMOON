# VPREMOON

## Very Preliminary REference MOON model

Density, P wave and S wave variation through the moon in a simple Python model. 

The data is all stored in the moondata.txt file. Download this and make sure the strdata = open("...""
is addressed to the appropriate location. 

All the three models (density, P wave and S wave velocities) are written as standalones so they require
only moondata.txt to run properly.
